Various "small" configuration files and scripts.

`install.sh` depends on GNU Stow.

DISCLAIMER
----------

Some scripts included in this repo may not be mine (for example
`git-forest`). I do not claim to be their author, they are just
convenient enough to keem them there. If you want your script out of
this repo, just let me know.
